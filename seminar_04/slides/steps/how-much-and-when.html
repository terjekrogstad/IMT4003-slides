<h2>How much and when?</h2>

<p>
    Essential, valuable and timely documentation
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Essential</strong> - Keep documentation concise
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Valuable</strong> - Documentation must be justified by value
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Timely</strong> - Documentation Just In Time (JIT)
</p>

    <p>
        Keep the documentation as concise as possible: overviews, road maps, and high-level architecture diagrams are generally preferred over detailed documentation.
    </p>
    <p>
        Agile projects prioritize work in the order of value, so the stakeholders must understand the value and total cost of ownership for a document, along with other requirements, and must explicitly choose to make that investment.
    </p>
    <p>
        Documentation should be done in a just-in-time (JIT) manner, when we need it. Ideally, we should create documentation throughout the entire software development life cycle when it makes the most sense.
