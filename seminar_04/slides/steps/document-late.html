<h2>Document late</h2>

<p>
    <strong>Defer the creation of documents as late as possible.</strong>
</p>
<p>
    System overviews etc. are best written towards the end of a development cycle of a release.
</p>


<div class="notes">
    <ul>
																		<li>You
                        have likely forgotten some of the reasons behind the
                        decisions that you made, clearly a problem if this is
																		important
																		to you.</li>
																		<li>You may not have the right
                        people anymore to write the documentation because
																		they've
																		moved on
																		to other
																		projects.</li>
																		<li>You may not
                        have funding to do the work.</li>
																		<li>The will to write the
                        documentation may no longer exist.  </li>
