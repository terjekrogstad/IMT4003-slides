<h2>Product Metrics</h2>

<p class="small-text">
  <b>Dynamic metrics - assess efficiency and reliability (Assessed runtime)</b>
  <ul class="small-text">
    <li>Response time (Performance)</li>
    <li>Number of failures (Reliability)</li>
    <li>etc.</li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p class="small-text">
  <b>Static metrics - assess complexity, understandability and maintainability (Assess system representation)</b><br/>
  Static metrics have an indirect relationship with quality attributes
</p>


<div class="notes">
  <p>
    Dynamic attributes<br/>
    Closely related to software quality attributes
  </p>
<p>
  Static attributes<br/>
  You need to try and derive a relationship between these metrics and properties such as complexity, understandability and maintainability. Assessed in code etc. (System representation)
