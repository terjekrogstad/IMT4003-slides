<h2>Project Process Quality</h2>

<p>The quality of a product is influenced by the quality of the production process</p>

<div class="notes">Typically in software development som attributes are hard to assess<br/>
However, there is a very complex and poorly understood relationship between software processes and product quality.<br/>
The application of individual skills and experience is particularly important in software development;<br/>
External factors such as the novelty of an application or the need for an accelerated development schedule may impair product quality.
