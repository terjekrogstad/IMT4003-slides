<h2>Challenges Related To Quality</h2>

<ul class="small-text">
  <li>Customer quality requirements (QR) may compromise developer QR</li>
  <li>QR are difficult to specify unambiguously</li>
  <li>Specifications are incomplete and inconsistent</li>
  <li>Requirements change</li>
</ul>


<div class="notes">
  Customer focus may be ’fitness for purpose’ rather than specification conformance.<br/>
  Agile methods seek to handle these challenges by micro-managing the process and making the process itself dynamic regarding requirements
