<h2>Software Quality Reviews</h2>

<ul class="small-text">
  <li>
    A group of people examine the software and documentation
  </li>
  <li>
    Software and documents may be 'signed off' as approvement
  </li>
</ul>


<div class="notes">
  Code, designs, specifications, test plans, standards, etc. can all be reviewed.<br/><br/>
  The review process in agile software development is usually informal. <br/>
In Scrum, for example, there is a review meeting after each iteration of the software has been completed (a sprint review), where quality issues and problems may be discussed.
