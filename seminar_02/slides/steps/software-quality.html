<h2>Software Quality</h2>

<p>
  Quality, simplistically, means that a software product should meet its specification.

<div class="notes">
  The scope of software quality management:<br/>
<ul>
  <li>Important for large, complex systems. The quality documentation is a record of progress and supports continuity of development as the development team changes.</li>
  <li>For smaller systems, quality management needs less documentation and should focus on establishing a quality culture.</li>
</ul>
