<h2>What is version control?</h2>

<p>
  Code changes: Bug-fixes, new features etc.
</p>
<p>
  Mistakes are made and developers often need to track back
</p>


<div class="notes">
Unfortunately, no programmer is perfect, and sometimes, mistakes are made. If you make a change to a file, save it, compile it, and find out that something went wrong, it's often helpful to be able to go back to the old version or to get a report of what was actually changed, in order to focus on what may have gone wrong.

That's where Version Control Systems come in.
