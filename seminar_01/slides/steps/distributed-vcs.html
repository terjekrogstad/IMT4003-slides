<div class="notes">
Recently a new breed of tools has appeared: so-called "distributed" version control systems (DVCS for short). The three most popular of these are Mercurial, Git and Bazaar. These systems do not necessarily rely on a central server to store all the versions of a project's files. Instead, every developer "clones" a copy of a repository and has the full history of the project on their own hard drive. This copy (or "clone") has all of the metadata of the original.

This method may sound wasteful, but in practice, it's not a problem.
