<div class="notes">Centralized Workflow<br/>

If your developers are already comfortable with Subversion, the Centralized Workflow lets you experience the benefits of Git without having to adapt to an entirely new process. It also serves as a friendly transition into more Git-oriented workflows.<br/>


Feature Branch Workflow<br/>

The Feature Branch Workflow builds on the Centralized Workflow by encapsulating new features into dedicated branches. This enables the use of pull requests as a means to discuss changes before theyâ€™re integrated into the official project.<br/>


Gitflow Workflow<br/>

The Gitflow Workflow streamlines the release cycle by using isolated branches for feature development, release preparation, and maintenance. Its strict branching model also lends some much needed structure to larger projects.<br/>
